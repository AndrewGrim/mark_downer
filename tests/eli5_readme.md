# ELI5 Programming

This website gathers curated video tutorials aimed at beginners.

With the advent of the internet came a lot of resources for learning, unforunately a lot of them just aren't any good.
As a beginner it is nigh on impossible to tell what is good and worth consuming versus what isn't.

This is where ELI5 Programming comes in.

We guarantee that any content linked to on this website is worth looking at.

For each language covered on the website we have a dedicated developer curating content for it so you don't have to filter anything out yourself.

Each video or playlist includes a description of what the content is and a summary of what it covers.

This is followed by any additional comments from the developer and a link to source code if it is available.
